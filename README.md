The Panasonic data breach that took place in 2022 was recreated by me on a much smaller and simpler scale, with similar attack tactics and techniques involved. An initial presentation was given just to highlight what the attack was and how I am going to implement it. Then an attack tutorial was made along with an incident report and a presentation to show the findings of the attack. I was also able to map down the attack techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK navigator.
**A network for 5 machines was made which comprised of:**
1. A database server
2. A file management server
3. An IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
4. An attacker machine
5. A workstation to simulate a victim user
